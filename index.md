#### [A Deep Dive Into Spotting Fake Reviews on Amazon](https://github.com/thaoduyentran/amazonfakereview)
Amazonâ€™s popularity and usage has risen at an exponential rate over the last few years. According to Statista, Amazon's brand value has surpassed 68 billion dollars with 200 million Prime members. Amazon has been exposed to numerous challenges as a result of its large user base, as new sellers struggle to generate enough traffic to their products. As a result, one of the most frequently encountered issues on Amazon is the use of phony positive reviews to increase sales of certain products. According to data gathered from Fakespot, a company that specializes in the identification of fake reviews and counterfeits for online retailers, the number of phony Amazon reviews is predicted to be between 40% and 45% of all global reviews as of June/July 2020. To demonstrate the presence of phony reviews on Amazon, we evaluated the amount of false verified accounts. The following graph illustrates the outcome. Appendix 1 contains the result demonstrating the existence of False Verify accounts.

To have a better look at this issue, we examined Amazon's historical statistics for the years 2008 and 2018 (from June 1st to September 30th). We chose these years as they can give us a good understand of the decade-long differences/similarities between Amazon usage and reviews, and these months do not include any major holidays, which can often overinflate reviews and purchases due to spikes in sale deals and offerings. Additionally, we use comments from Amazon's "Electronics" category, as it is one of the most popular product categories available, which means it also has the highest number of reviews and review diversity. According to the Amazon website, to become a verified customer, an account must spend at least $50 on Amazon in the preceding 12 months or purchase a product without receiving a significant discount; this will be important for our analysis, which will sometimes include splits between verified and unverified reviews.

#### [The Economic Value of College Majors](https://github.com/thaoduyentran/ROIeducation/)
Education is usually considered a long-term and low-risk investment for most people. However, without proper research and analysis about employment outcome and the salary range of a chosen major, the ROI in higher education could disappoint students with unrealistic expectations. I conduct this analysis to provide useful insights about the short- and long-term financial implications of college major decision.<br>

The data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available here by the Wall Street Journal for their article Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay. I compared the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means clustering analysis, and visualize the results.

#### Conclusion <br>
While it's tempting to focus on starting career salaries when choosing a major, it's important to also consider the growth potential down the road. Keep in mind that whether a major falls into the Liberal Arts, Goldilocks, or Over Achievers cluster, one's financial destiny will certainly be influenced by numerous other factors including the school attended, location, passion or talent for the subject, and of course the actual career(s) pursued.

#### [Risk & Return Analysis based on The Sharpe Ratio](https://github.com/thaoduyentran/riskreturn/)
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago. It compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns. This project provides a brief comparison of the profitability vs risk between Facebook and Amazon Stocks vs the benchmark S&P 500 Index

##### Conclusion
An investment in Amazon returned twice as much compared to the S&P 500 for each unit of risk an investor would have assumed. In other words, in risk-adjusted terms, the investment in Amazon would have been more attractive.
The Sharpe Ratio helps to make a decision by adjusting the returns by the differences in risk and allows an investor to compare investment opportunities on equal terms, that is, on an 'apples-to-apples' basis.
