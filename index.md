### Data Analytics Projects
#### The Sharpe Ratio: Risk & Return Analysis (http://example.com/https://github.com/thaoduyentran/riskreturn) 
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago. It compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns. This project provides a brief comparison of the profitability vs risk between Facebook and Amazon Stocks vs the benchmark S&P 500 Index 



##### Conclusion
In 2016, Amazon had a Sharpe ratio twice as high as Facebook. This means that an investment in Amazon returned twice as much compared to the S&P 500 for each unit of risk an investor would have assumed. In other words, in risk-adjusted terms, the investment in Amazon would have been more attractive.
This difference was mostly driven by differences in return rather than risk between Amazon and Facebook. The risk of choosing Amazon over FB (as measured by the standard deviation) was only slightly higher so that the higher Sharpe ratio for Amazon ends up higher mainly due to the higher average daily returns for Amazon.
When faced with investment alternatives that offer both different returns and risks, the Sharpe Ratio helps to make a decision by adjusting the returns by the differences in risk and allows an investor to compare investment opportunities on equal terms, that is, on an 'apples-to-apples' basis.
