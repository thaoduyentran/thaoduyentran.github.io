#### The Sharpe Ratio: Risk & Return Analysis (S&P 500 Companies)
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago. It compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns. I use pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.
