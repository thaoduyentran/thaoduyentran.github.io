#### [Return on investment in higher education based on major analysis](https://github.com/thaoduyentran/ROIeducation/)
Education is usually considered a long-term and low-risk investment for most people. However, without proper research and analysis, the ROI in higher education could disappoint students with unrealistic expectations. I conduct this analysis to provide some useful insights about the short- and long-term financial implications of undergraduate and graduate major decision.<br>

Comparison in Starting vs. Mid Career Median Salaries.

The data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available here by the Wall Street Journal for their article Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay. I compared the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means clustering analysis, and visualize the results. 
A deeper dive analysis into the clusters

Conclusion
While it's tempting to focus on starting career salaries when choosing a major, it's important to also consider the growth potential down the road. Keep in mind that whether a major falls into the Liberal Arts, Goldilocks, or Over Achievers cluster, one's financial destiny will certainly be influenced by numerous other factors including the school attended, location, passion or talent for the subject, and of course the actual career(s) pursued.

#### [Risk & Return Analysis based on The Sharpe Ratio](https://github.com/thaoduyentran/riskreturn/)
The Sharpe Ratio, developed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharpe some 50 years ago. It compares the return of an investment to that of an alternative and relates the relative return to the risk of the investment, measured by the standard deviation of returns. This project provides a brief comparison of the profitability vs risk between Facebook and Amazon Stocks vs the benchmark S&P 500 Index

##### Conclusion
An investment in Amazon returned twice as much compared to the S&P 500 for each unit of risk an investor would have assumed. In other words, in risk-adjusted terms, the investment in Amazon would have been more attractive.
The Sharpe Ratio helps to make a decision by adjusting the returns by the differences in risk and allows an investor to compare investment opportunities on equal terms, that is, on an 'apples-to-apples' basis.
